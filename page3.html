    <p>If we don't act quickly, we will face potentially irreversible dire consequences. Breathing polluted air can cause irratation to the lungs, which can cause asthma (and worsen it for people who already suffer from it.) There are also implications for conditions like dementia, diabetes and even lung cancer.</p>
</div>

<div class="page3div2">
    <p>Broader impacts on the environment include: Acid rain - Air pollutants can infuse with water and soil, harming plants and the animals that eat them. <br><br>Reduction of biodiversity - If air pollution alters habitats, they won't be suitable for the animals that live there, which will reduce biodiversity (animals become more similar to each other, meaning they compete with each other more directly)<br><br>Natural disasters - Air pollution as a result of climate change makes extreme weather events such as droughts happen more frequently and intensely.</p>
