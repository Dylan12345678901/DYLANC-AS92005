    <h1>What are the statistics associated with pollution in New Zealand?</h1>
</div>
<div class="page2div1">
    <p>New Zealand has an unusual global emissions profile when compared to the rest of the world. <br> For example, 48% of emissions came from the agriculture industry, compared to only 24% global average, and only 11% average for<br> Kyoto Protocol Annex 1 countries. This is due to our economic reliance on exporting animal products such as dairy, wool, and meat.<br><br>Air pollution is increasing every year, often faster than it ever has before. In 2023, the average PM10 (microparticles in the air) concentration in Auckland increased by 1.8% <br>compared to 2022. In addition to this, concentration of PM2.5 (smaller microscopic particles) increased by 1.6% in 2023 compared to 2022. </p>
