    <h1>What are the statistics associated with pollution in New Zealand?</h1>
</div>
<div class="page2div1">
    <p>New Zealand has an unusual global emissions profile when compared to the rest of the world. <br> For example, 48% of emissions came from the agriculture industry, compared to only 24% global average, and only 11% average for Kyoto Protocol Annex 1 countries. This is due to our economic reliance on exporting animal products such as dairy, wool, and meat.</p>
