    <h1>Air Pollution in New Zealand</h1>
</div>

<div class="page1div1">
<h4>New Zealand's air pollution is relatively low, but still a cause for concern. <br> High levels of agriculture contribute to air pollution, due to:<br><br>Synthetic fertilisers. These can release ammonia and nitrous oxide into the air.<br><br>Poor management of animal waste. Manure can further contribute to ammonia released into the air. <br><br>Tilling of soil releases dust into the air, which counts as particulate matter.<br><br> Further contributing to air pollution is our widespread use of woodburners to heat homes, along with emissions from transport and industry.  </h4>
